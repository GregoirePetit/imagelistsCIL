[Google Landmarks v1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google/google-landmarks-dataset) is a subset of a landmarks recognition dataset which includes a total of over 30000 classes. We select the 1000 classes having the largest number of images. The training and testing sets are composed of 374,367 and 20,000 images, respectively. All the images should be placed then in the same directory, that you indicate on the first line of the files [train.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/google_landmarks/train.lst#L1) and [test.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/google_landmarks/test.lst)
