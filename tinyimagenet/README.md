TinyImagenet is commonly used in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). It is a subset of [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) that contains 200 classes. It can be downloaded [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip). All the images should be placed then in the same directory, that you indicate on the first line of the files [train.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/tinyimagenet/train.lst#L1) and [test.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/tinyimagenet/test.lst)
