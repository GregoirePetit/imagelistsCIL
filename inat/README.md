iNaturalist is a subset of the dataset used for the [iNaturalist challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2018). The full version includes 10000 fine-grained classes for natural species. We sample 1000 classes from different super-categories in order to obtain a visually diversified dataset. The training and testing sets are composed of 300,000 and 10,000 images, respectively. All the images should be placed then in the same directory, that you indicate on the first line of the files [train.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/inat/train.lst#L1) and [test.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/inat/test.lst)
