ImagenetSubset is commonly used in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). It is a subset of [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) that contains 100 classes. It can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5Xg7Iye_wkzVKc0MTBao5adhYSUlMCL/view?usp=sharing). All the images should be placed then in the same directory, that you indicate on the first line of the files [train.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/imagenetsubset/train.lst#L1) and [test.lst](https://github.com/GregoirePetit/imagelistsCIL/blob/master/imagenetsubset/test.lst)
